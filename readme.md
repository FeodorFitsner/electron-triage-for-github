> Desktop app for dividing GitHub issues and pull requests into go or no-go quickly.

Enable to classify a lot of issues and pull requests.


## Motivation

We can use an ecosystem with GitHub - CI, coverage and pull requests.

E.g.

* [Dependency Update as a Service - Tachikoma.io](http://tachikoma.io/)
* [greenkeeper](http://greenkeeper.io/)
* [deppbot - Automated Dependency Updates](https://www.deppbot.com/)

(Use tachikoma.io, please!)

But too many pull requests bother us.

Especially build app by empty pull request like ping, we want to close pull
request quickly after confirming CI 'success'.


### Plan A: `/pulls`

See: https://github.com/pulls

![github pulls](./pages/github-pulls.gif)

to what we want. But we should click a pull request, open a
pull request page, click close button, close pull request page, click a pull
request, ...
It's too much.


### Plan B: Triage for GitHub

That is where "Triage for GitHub" comes in.
We can triage GitHub issues and pull requests.
We can also "Jump" to details with GitHub UI.


## How to use


### Set up

Download [Latest release](https://github.com/lyrictenor/electron-triage-for-github/releases/latest) for your own environment.

![settings](./pages/settings.gif)

Set GitHub personal token, scope `repo` or `public_repo`.

### Experimental: Autopilot

Set autopilot on, then you get interval autopilot.

If your autopilot hang up, move to debug pane and execute force unlock.


### Details

There is details about an issue and a pull request with "v" icon.
